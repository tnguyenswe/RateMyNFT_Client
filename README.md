# Running the app

```
git clone https://github.com/tnguyenswe/RateMyNFT.git
cd RateMyNFT
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

You may need to manually install axios with ```npm install axios``` then do ```npm run build``` 

If that doesn't work, you'll have to remove node_modules and package-lock.json

then do:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
